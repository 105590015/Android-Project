### 作業說明
---
1. Refer to Unit052, Unit053, Unit057, Unit 060 and implement the following requirements：
* Change the app title to "作業十: your name".
* Refer to Unit027 and create two Fragments: "AddNewContact" and "SearchContact". The AddNewContact is used to add a new contact (including name, phone number, and the type of phone number). It has two TextViews and corresponding EditTexts for users to enter name and phone number. It also has a Spinner for users to select the type of the phone number, such as mobile, home, and office. The SearchContact will show all the contacts using a ListView and allow users to search a specific contact by giving the name of the contact. If the specific contact is found, your app will highlight the contact in one way or another. Otherwise, show a message like "the contact is not found" using Toast.
* Refer to Unit060 and use SQLite to insert (i.e., add) and query (i.e., search) the contact info.
* Refer to Unit057 and allow users to switch between the above two Fragments using Tab. You may also use the ViewPager, FragmentPagerAdapter, and TabLayout to implement Tab.
* Instead of using Buttons, you may use an Options Menu (Unit052) to implement the action of "adding a new contact" and an Action Bar [with an icon] (Unit054) to implement the action of "searching a contact".
