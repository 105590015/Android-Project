### 作業說明
1. Copy your HW#6 to another app and rename the app as HW#7
2. Import HW#7 and modify the code according to the following requirements：
* Change the app title to "作業七: your name".
* Change the game rolling-a-dice in which a user can click a Button and the computer will randomly generate a number ranging from 1 to 6. If the generated number is greater than 4 then computer wins. If the number is equal to 3 or 4, then the result is draw. Otherwise, the user wins. Use a Toast to show the game result (i.e., user wins, computer wins, or draw). Update the program and resource accordingly.
* Moreover, when the user click the Button, your app shall show a dice-rolling animation in an ImageView. You may refer to Unit024 for drawable animation.
* Keep tracking of the game statistics, including the total number of game that has been played and the total number of computer/user win and draw. Use another activity to show the game statistics and provide one Button to show the game statistics.
* The layout of the "game-statistics" activity shall use LinearLayout. In addition to show the game statistics, the layout of this activity shall also contain a Button. When the user click that Button, the app will go back to previous activity (i.e., MainActivity).
